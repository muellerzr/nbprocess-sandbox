A testing ground of sorts to play with nbprocess

## How to use

This library (and repository) contains a variety of
tutorials/experiments using
[nbprocess](https://github.com/fastai/nbprocess). Ideally these
experiments will be me testing how close
[nbagile](https://github.com/muellerzr/nbagile) can be to existance with
this new framework.

Implemented in this repo:

-   Automatically exporting notebook tests into a pytest
    `unittest.TestCase` format inside a `tests/` directory. (see 00_core
    and 01_export)
